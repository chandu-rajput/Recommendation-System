# 🎬 Movie Recommender System

* "This app uses a Hybrid Filtering approach (Cosine Similarity + IMDb Weighted Ratings) to find your next favorite movie."

# My Awesome Streamlit App

## 🚀 Live Demo
You can view the live version of this app here:
[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://recommendation-system-dyficwxopxbvhhorgc3jfq.streamlit.app/)

## 🚀 Features

* 🔍 Content-based recommendations using TF-IDF
* ⭐ IMDB-style weighted rating system
* 🎯 Hybrid recommendation (similarity + weighted rating system)
* 🌐 Interactive UI with Streamlit
* ⚡ Fast similarity search using cosine similarity

## 🧠 The Hybrid Algorithm
The system calculates a final score by combining two metrics:
1. Content-Based Filtering (60%): Uses TF-IDF Vectorization on movie overviews and genres, then calculates the Cosine Similarity between vectors.
2. Weighted Rating (40%): To avoid recommending obscure movies with a single 10-star rating, we use the IMDB Weighted Rating formula:
      $$W = \frac{v}{v+m} \cdot R + \frac{m}{v+m} \cdot C$$$
* v$: Number of votes for the movie
* $m$: Minimum votes required to be listed
* $R$: Average rating of the movie
*  $C$: Mean vote across the whole report

## 🧠 How It Works

This system combines two approaches:

* **60% Content-Based Filtering**

  * Uses TF-IDF vectorization on movie metadata
  * Computes cosine similarity between movies

* **40% Weighted Rating (IMDB Formula)**

  * Uses a Bayesian average to rank popular movies
  * Balances vote count and vote average
